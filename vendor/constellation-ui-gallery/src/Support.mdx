# Support

This project is an open source project based on an [Apache 2 license](https://github.com/pegasystems/constellation-ui-gallery?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme).

Here is an extract of the license: "software distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.".

In term of support and maintenance, this project follows the same approach as any other open source libraries - code is delivered as IS and since you are importing the components in your application ruleset, you are responsible for this code inside your application including support for any accessibility issues or issues after upgrade. The source code is provided and you can fork the code and make any change you want.

The project provides released version of the components for Pega Infinity 23.1, 24.1, 24.2 and 25.1 releases but only the latest Pega Platform version (25.1) will be actively worked on.

To contribute to this project, submit your idea to the [discussion board](https://github.com/pegasystems/constellation-ui-gallery/discussions/categories/ideas). If you want to submit a branch with some enhancements, [create a fork of this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)

When adding new components, make sure that:

- The component is written in Typescript.
- The component follow [best practices](https://pegasystems.github.io/constellation-ui-gallery/?path=/docs/getting-started--docs#implementing-a-constellation-dx-component).
- The component props are exposed as an interface type object with description and default values so that the table of properties is documented in storybook.
- Make sure that all files are linted correctly (npm run lint and npm run fix).
- Make sure that all styles follow best practices (no use for px, no hardcoded colors...)
- Make sure that you have a unit test.
- Make sure that end to end and accessibility test is passing (see [README.md](https://github.com/pegasystems/constellation-ui-gallery/blob/master/README.md#end-to-end-testing) for instructions).
- If using a 3rd party library, make sure that the library is open source and compatible with the React version and the Constellation component library - see [Library](https://pegasystems.github.io/constellation-ui-gallery/?path=/docs/libraries--docs).
- You are not using a 3rd party presentational component library like Material UI - All the components should use the Constellation presentational components.
- Do not include 3rd party icon library - there should be enough OOB icons in the Constellation presentational component library.
- Test your component with different themes using the Storybook toolbar - the theme branding color and other tokens should be correctly handled by your components
- The for right to left (rtl) using the Storybook toolbar.
