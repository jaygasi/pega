# Overview

Meters are visual representations of a quantity or an achievement. Their progress is determined by user actions, rather than system actions. This component will use a percentage field type to render the value between 0 and 100. If the value that you want to render is an integer, create a declare expression to generate a percentage value.

The meter should not be used to indicate progress, such as loading or percent completion of a task. To communicate progress, use the Loading component in the presentational library.
