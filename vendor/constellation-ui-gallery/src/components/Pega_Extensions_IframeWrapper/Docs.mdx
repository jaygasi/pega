# Overview

This field-level component allows to render an iframe - the url of the iframe is set to the value of the input field

The height can be set to a fixed height or auto - if auto is selected, the iframe is resized automatically to align with the iframe content.

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls />

## Configuration

When the mode is set to 'auto', the browser will block any access to the content of the iframe if the url is on a different domain due to cross-Origin resource sharing (CORS).

Make sure that the embedded site sets "access-control-allow-origin" in the response header to the domain of the main document. If this is not set, you will see the following error in the console

```
Refused to display 'https://xxxx' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.
```

For the iframe resize logic to work, the inner iframe needs to set its height on content change through the postMessage API. Here is a sample of code
to add once the application is loaded:

```
// Resize observer for sending the height of the iframe to the parent
if(window.parent) {
  const onResize = () => {
    // Obviously you can format your data object however you want
    window.parent.postMessage({
      type: 'resize',
      height: document.body.scrollHeight,
    }, '*');
  }

  (new ResizeObserver( () =>
    onResize()
  )).observe(document.body);
}
```
