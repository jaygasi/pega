# Overview

The Kanban board components renders a list of tasks grouped into different columns. The tasks are displayed as cards and can be moved to different columns using drag and drop.
This UI is typical for Scrum board where user stories or tasks are grouped by status.

This component will use a case type to represent the tasks. The list of tasks is passed using a page list Data Page. If you need to pass a context to the data page, you can set the 'contextProperty' to pass this content - the data page will then be called with the parameter 'key' and the value of this property.

The component supports the following features:

- The list of columns is passed as a comma-separated list to the components using the 'groups' property
- Ability to create a new task through an action in the header by setting the 'createClassname' property
- Tasks are rendered using a details view and not hardcoded inside the component, which allows to use visible when and other features to personalize the content of the card
- If the cards are moved to a 'Resolved-' status, the card becomes read-only and can no longer be moved or edited
- The component is fully [accessible](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd/blob/main/docs/about/accessibility.md). After selecting a card, use 'space' to initiate the drag and arrow keys to move the card inside the board.

The implementation of this component relies on the library [@hello-pangea/dnd](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd). This library is a fork of the [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) library which is no longer maintained.
The library delivers the best drag and drop experience, is written in Typescript and is full accessible.

## Limitations

The limitations of the components are:

- Only one case type support - no support for multiple case types in the same board
- Does not use a property to set the position in the column - the cards are ordered by how they are listed in the displayed
- Does not set the position in the column when dragging / dropping the card
- Does not support data types
- Tasks are always editable and draggable (except if in Resolved- column)
- List of groups does not support a property reference and is a static list

## Example

Here is a demo of how to configure this component in App Studio. For this example, we have created a 'User Story' case type and we will render the case based on the value of pyStatusWork.
When creating a case type, the platform will automatically create a list DP and a single look up DP created and we will use these OOB Data pages.
Before configuring the widget, we just need to create a new details view that will be used to render the card. The view can use conditions on pyStatusWork to hide / show certain fields.
We also leverage the 'Case reference' Constellation DX component to show the case ID using a previewable link.
