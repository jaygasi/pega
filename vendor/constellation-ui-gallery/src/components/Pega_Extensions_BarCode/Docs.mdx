# Overview

The Barcode field will let you generate different formats of barcode. The field property associated with the component will store a base64 svg image of the barcode.
If the component is inside a form and editable, it is possible to enter an input property that will be used to generate the barcode on the client.
If the component is marked as readonly, the field property will render the barcode image directly.
You need to make sure that the field property is of type text and is long enough to store a complete base64 image (set the length to 50000).

If you can want display the barcode inside a createPDF shape, you can pass the text field as an image inside the section rule configured to generate the PDF.

# Example

Here is a demo of how to configure this component in App Studio. For this example, we have created a 'Service' case type and we will render Barcode based on `inputProperty`.
When changing the value of the input property in the form, the barcode is automatically re-generated.

# Generating a Printable QR Code PDF

You can insert the field property created by the component into a PDF by including it as an image. Before configuring the createPDF shape, revert to traditional UI to open the section rule that will be used to generate the PDF document.

And that's it! We now have a QR code that can be generated in the view and printed as a PDF.
