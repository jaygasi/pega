# Overview

The FieldGroupAsRow component allows to render a field group horizontally instead of being render vertically - This behavior could be used to compare a couple of objects side-by-side or to reduce the amount of vertical scrolling.

The component creates a wrapper DIV using styled component that changes the display of the fieldset component from a column to a row direction.
