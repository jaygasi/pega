# Overview

The Shortcuts utility renders a list of links inside a card - Each link will open a page inside your application or could open an external URL.

The widget can render the links on a single row (displayType = 'simple') or group them by category. When using the 'grouped' displayType, a JSON object must be passed as a string.
