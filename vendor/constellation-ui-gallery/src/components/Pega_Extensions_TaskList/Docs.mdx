## Overview

The Task List is a simple and configurable component designed for tracking task progress.

- Tasks can be toggled between completed (`true`) and pending (`false`) statuses.
- Each task contains:
  - **Id**: A unique identifier for the task.
  - **Label**: A descriptive label for the task.
  - **IsCompleted**: A boolean indicating if the task is completed (`true`) or pending (`false`).
