# Overview

The Map component showcases how to run the ArcGIS Map component inside Constellation UI - The [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) helps build interactive user experiences and 2D and 3D visualizations.
A license and key is required to use this component - Before using this component is your application, review the [licensing requirements](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/licensing/).

The component has 2 different modes of operations depending of the value of the bFreeFormDrawing parameter:

- If bFreeFormDrawing is true, it is intended to use a location field in the region to render a map component - You can search a location and use the sketch tool. The shapes drawn with the sketch tool can be persisted in the case using the selectionProperty property of type text.
- If bFreeFormDrawing is false, it is intended to draw a list of positions on the map in order to map a route.

The component supports the following features:

- Center on a global map by providing latitude, longitude and zoom
- If bFreeFormDrawing = true, will display the sketch tool to allow for freeform drawing on the map - The drawings are persisted in the selectionProperty as a JSON string.
- If bFreeFormDrawing = false, will provide the ability to draw a set of positions by clicking on the map - double click to terminate the polyline. The list of positions is stored in the case as an embedded data list object on form submit. A 'Clear' action allows to delete the trajectory
- Read only mode support when put in the display template - no freeform drawing or draw some positions
- If bShowSearch = true, will display a search input on the map to search for a specific address or use your current location
- If bFreeFormDrawing = false, can pass a URL field type that can be used to store a base64 image of the map
- createTools is used to filter the list of tools available in the sketch component

The initial can either be passed as a constant values by passing longitude, latitude and zoom as string values.
You can also set locationInputType to 'propertyRef' to dynamically set the location. In this case, pass the location field as the parameter of the Region A and set the zoom value by passing a field of type text.

# Example

To use this component for mapping a route, set bFreeFormDrawing to false. You will need an embedded data list with 2 fields: Latitude and Longitude. In a form template, add a new view based on this template and select the 2 properties
from the embedded list data object - make sure to put the Latitude field first. If needed, you can specify a 3rd field on the case type formatted as URL that can hold
an image of the map - the Image field must be large enough to hold the base64 content (see length to 50000) and should not have any validation enabled on the field for URL.

Here is an example of how to configure this component in App Studio when bFreeFormDrawing is false. For this example, we have created a 'Map' case type and we will render Map component.
The case type is composed of an embedded data list called 'Positions'

To use the template, add the fields to the region in this order

To use this component as a location field, add a location field to the region of the template and set bFreeFormDrawing to true. You can enable search and get your current location.

To use this component to draw some free form shapes and store the shapes in the case, pass a valid field as Selection Property - Make sure that the field is of type text and large enough to store all the shape coordinates as a json object.
