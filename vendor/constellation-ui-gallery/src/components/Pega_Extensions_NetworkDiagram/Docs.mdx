# Overview

The Network Diagram component allows to represent a complex tree diagram of relationship between different object types. The objects are represented as node and can be stored as data or case types.
The relation between each object can be represented by a label and a type.

To configure this component, you need to a provide a page Data Page of type Embed-Graph that contains nodes (as pyNodes) and edges (as pyEdges). You can look at the storybook code for an example of the expected response from this data page.
By default the DP is not parametrized. If you set the field selectionProperty to a certain value, then the DP will be called using the parameter pyGUID set to this property.

This component supports the following features:

- Render specific node type with svg image based on type.
- Edges with label
- Auto-layout of the diagram using the Dagre library
- Ability to zoom, refresh the diagram.
- Support for preview for nodes that are cases or data objects if the pzInsKey is passed.
- Drag / drop nodes to re-order the diagram.
- Nodes and edges are focusable, and the UI is keyboard accessible (need further testing and validation).
- Ability to change edge path to Bezier, straight or steps.
- This code leverage the React Flow and Dagre library - These 2 libraries are under the MIT license and open source.
