# Overview

The actionable button component is a field level component that can only be used in a details view. It allows to drop inside any view a button that can be used to trigger a local action.

This is similar to the 'Edit' button inside the Case View Summary. Using visible when condition, the action can be shown to a user only if a specific condition is met.
The button can also be used in a Details tab or other read-only tab to provide a quick access to the local action.

This component should NOT be put inside a form view since it will update the case in the database on submit and won't refresh the form data.

The local action will always run in a modal dialog - the content of the modal could be a form or could be used to display read only information. This component will also only work on Case type.

To use this component, select the key of the object. For a case type, the field name would be 'Instance Key Handle', for a data object it would be 'pyGUID'. Enter the name of the local action ID to execute (for example pyUpdateCaseDetails).

Note: The button will not be visible if the value of the property containing the key is empty or if the local ID is empty.
