The following libraries are used in the Constellation DX Components UI Gallery:

# Core Constellation libraries

- **@pega/cosmos-xx** version 8.x for Pega 25.1

The following libraries must be in sync with the Constellation DX Components UI Gallery to avoid dependency and side effect issues.

- **React** 18.x
- **Styled Components** 5.3.11 (exact version)

There has been issues with the Styled Components library using different versions within the same document (especially different major versions) as well as incompatibilities with libraries using React 17 and React 18.

# 3rd party libraries used at runtime

When selecting a 3rd party lib, it is critical to select one that is compatible with React 18 and the Constellation DX Components UI Gallery.
