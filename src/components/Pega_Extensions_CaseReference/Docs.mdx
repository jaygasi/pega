# Overview

The case reference component is a field-level component that renders the case ID as a link in details form. This is similar to use a case reference property, but this component will show the same UI for your current case.
This component can be useful when rendering the case ID in a details template like the Kanban Board Component where you want to show a case Reference inside a details view.

To use this component, select the field 'Instance key' from the object that you want to expose as a link and set the label field.
