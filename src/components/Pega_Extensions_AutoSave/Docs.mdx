# Overview

This component will auto-save a specific input field on blur without having to click on the 'Save for later' button. This component does not render any UI.
You can enhance this component and instead of auto-saving the value on blur, you can save the value regularly if it has changed (for example every 2 seconds).

To use this component, select a Text field in the form and enter the name of the property to monitor.
