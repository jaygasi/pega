# Overview

The CompareTableLayout component is a template component that let you compare side-by-side different objects. It will present different instances of an object for comparison and will present the ability to select one of this instance.
To support selection, you need to have a field with a label set to 'ID' in one of the properties to render and you need to set a field name that will be used to store the selected value. In the demo, only the 'spreadsheet' format allows to turn on/off the ability to select an object.

Note: When using this component in 'select' mode, the object is expected to be a case reference. This component has not been tested for other use cases like data references (either sourced in Pega or externally).

## Properties

Setting a field in the 'selectionProperty' parameter in authoring will let you select one of the objects presented in the table.
The selection is expected to be a case reference. You can also change some of the display to look more like a financial report as well as customize how currency values are rendered.
