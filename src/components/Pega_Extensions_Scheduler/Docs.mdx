# Overview

The scheduler is a field-level component that can be used inside an assignment to display the events of a current date for a list of participants. The view
can help determine if these participants will be available before schedule a meeting.

The component will parse the value of the field as a JSON object.
It will derive the date, start and end time of the event and the list of other events attended by the participants.
