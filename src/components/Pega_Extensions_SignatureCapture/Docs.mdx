# Overview

This field-level component allows to write a signature and store it in a 'text' field as an svg base64 file. You need to make sure that the field property is of type text and is long enough to store a complete base64 image (set the length to 50000).
The same content can be rendered as read-only and will display the svg as an image.

If you can want display the signature inside a createPDF shape, you can pass the text field as an image inside the section rule configured to generate the PDF.
